# Parallax galery

### 🗨️ Description

This is an interactive parallax gallery project featuring a unique rotating layout and stunning visual effects. The gallery showcases a collection of images with smooth parallax animations as you scroll. Each image can be expanded with a click, creating an immersive viewing experience. The project combines creative CSS transforms with JavaScript interactions to achieve an engaging 3D-like effect, where foreground and background elements move at different speeds, adding depth and dynamism to the presentation.

This project was created following a tutorial from the [WebDesign Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLbI7BGdQ3o) YouTube channel.
